<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Duandon, king of Aetria’s farthest bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lord of isles the sea is loud around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld the crimson fountains of the dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear up the lark, a foam of song, till drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By some new sorrow in the ocean’s tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither he fared, expectant and alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither he fared, fresh from the sea of sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the balmy land was blossomed deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could one wander save on helpless flow’rs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Summer made a garland of the hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bound it on the dew-dipt brow of Morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bent low above the meadow’s blossom-bourn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But past all peace of bowers rang the call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And invocation of the billows’ fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, clean from kingdoms of the sapphire vast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds of ocean smote his brow at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afar he saw the eddying petrel sweep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er reefs where hoarser roared the thwarted deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon before his eyes, exultant, fain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy with azure gleamed the investing main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quick with pulsings of a distant storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong as that music floating Troy to form.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Splendid the everlasting ocean shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As God’s blue robe upon a desert thrown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Landward he saw the sea-born breakers fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young as a wind and ancient as the air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">August he saw the unending ranks uproll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With joy and wonder mastering the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With marvel on the hearing and the sight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green fires, and billows tremulous with light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shaken soul of light and shuddering blaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of leaping emerald and cold chrysoprase,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The surge and suspiration of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great waters choral of eternity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_11" id="page_11">{11}</a></span>&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty dirge that will not cease for day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor all the stars’ invincible array,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thunder that hath set, since Time began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its sorrow in the lonely heart of man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long stood the king before that wide review,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divining, deep beyond its sound and hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfathomable mystery and dream,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rapture and woe illusive but supreme;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the pine against the sea-wind sighs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thrilled his breast with whispers and surmise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, on a beach that only he might roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea, from broadest tapestries of foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From mighty looms immaculate and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A scarlet shell before his feet uprolled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wet as with blood against the dawn it flamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep-whorled and irised, lustrous and unnamed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A jewel of the sea that burned and shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some king-ruby ravished from a throne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_12" id="page_12">{12}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long Duandon wandered, all-amazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long upon the shell’s wild beauty gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, half-unwitting, swiftly to his ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He held it, fain as any child to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That echo like the murmuring of seas&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Astray forever on a mournful breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And borne from some remote, nocturnal bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat a voice, in sorceries of sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which the grace of vanished lyres had clung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang from the shell as never voice hath sung:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>Far down, where virgin silence reigns,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>In jasper evenings of the sea,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>I toss my pearls, I wait for thee.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>The sea hath lent me all its stains:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>It is but treasure-house of me.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>The corals of the deep have caught</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>A Titan shell whose fragile dome</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_13" id="page_13">{13}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>Is crimson o’er mine ocean home&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Mine opal chambers subtly wrought</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>In semblance of the shaken foam.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>Oh, come! and thou shalt dream with me</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>By violet foam at twilight tost</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>On strands of ocean islets lost</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>To prows that seek them wearily,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>O’er seas by questing sunsets crost.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>All dreams that Hope hath promised Love,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>All beauty thou hast sought in vain,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>All joy held once and lost again,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>These, and the mystery thereof,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i6"><i>I guard beneath the sundering main.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So rang that crystal cry, as from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear as the voice of Heaven’s whitest star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strong Duandon pondered, with his gaze<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_14" id="page_14">{14}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set like twin stars above those azure ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keener his heart, a plummet, yearned to sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gulf that held his soul amazed and bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, darker for the sky’s unclouded dome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves took sudden coronals of foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till half he deemed he saw, far out, the white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flung arms and bosom of the ocean-sprite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hour beyond hour, until the sun was fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strode he on sands that none but he might tread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hour beyond hour one sight his vision drank&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A foam-white arm that beckoned once, and sank.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, wave to wave in deeper anthems roared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And realm by realm the belted sunset soared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As tho’ a city of the Titans burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lands below the sea-line, undiscerned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till desolation touched it, zone by zone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its splendors gone, like jewels turned to stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sad with evening sang the ocean-choirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Domed by the stars’ imperishable fires.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_15" id="page_15">{15}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still Duandon lingered on the sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clasped the shell with indecisive hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ghostly it gleamed, nor music would outpour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save of the sea on some disastrous shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still he stood, and listened but to hark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The surf, like dragons battling in the dark;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Implacable they ravened, ere the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A towering glory on the eastern dune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A frozen splendor on the seething strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silver webs had snared the sea and land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as on hostile waves her arrows leapt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Duandon turned him from the sea, and slept.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slept, but the morning found him yet again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lonely searcher of the lonelier main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And night by night, and day by barren day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent he stood before the waves’ array&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victim of an unrelenting strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of joy with death, of love with love of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever at dawn the voice from out the shell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renewed within his heart the siren’s spell;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_16" id="page_16">{16}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever the wild, enchanting melody<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang as the sun was wedded to the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still the royal pageant of the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before his doom-bewildered eyes unfurled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dusky stain of sunsets northward drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cloudy headlands of the coasts of dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond that realm of jade and jade-bound bays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the sapphire fields of ocean blaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard the alliant waters chant their rune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the turquoise battlements of noon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where evening armies of the mist would roam<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Do I remember Unda, for alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all her band she mourned, nor would be still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore our lord at last was wroth with her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put her forth, for that she ever wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the northern gate, forbidding that she turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again unto her kindred. And some say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she within the jungle perished, some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to a city of the west she fared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dwelt in shame. Doubtless she long is dead.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nila gazed upon the land and sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woven for man’s illusion, and beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scarlet petals fallen from their stem.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cloud had gone; the wind was fled away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nila turned him from the veils of Time,<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Moreover, the Lord made question of Job, and asked,</p>

<p>2. To what end dost thou search Me, seeing that My wisdom is not as
thine?</p>

<p>3. Shalt thou question My ways, or have dreams concerning My
justice? Am not I the Lord?</p>

<p>4. Who hath strange laughter, Whose judgments are not as those of
the elders;</p>

<p>5. Who leadeth the lamb from the den of the she-wolf, and armies to
the quicksand;</p>

<p>6. Who slayeth the prince in his youth, and rulers at their
marriage-feast, but maketh the slave to grow old in his bondage;</p>

<p>7. Whose rains go forth on bitter waters, tho the land thirsteth;
Who delivereth thee from the javelin thou beholdest not;</p>

<p>8. Who maketh the king in his secret place and him<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136">{136}</a></span> that the
vultures did devour to sleep the same sleep;</p>

<p>9. Who confoundeth the sea, but leadeth the ant to her desire.</p>

<p>10. Have not I sharpened the beak of the kite against the day of
thy hope; the raven’s beak against the eyes of thy young men?</p>

<p>11. I shall bar thee from thy joy with a thread of gossamer; I
shall bind thy sin to thy children’s children with ropes of
adamant.</p>

<p>12. The rock is a bolt for My treasure-house. Thou knockest in vain
upon the doors thereof.</p>

<p>13. Who art thou that eternity should hold parley with thee, or the
pits of the sky be thy fortress?</p>

<p>14. Thou abidest in My sight as the smoke of a sacrifice, or as the
grey moth in the conspection of the stars.</p>

<p>15. What hast thou if thou hast not Me? Thou takest to thee strange
wine, and the kiss of the asp that it comfort thee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137">{137}</a></span></p>

that conceive;</p>

<p>18. Who teacheth fear with an arrow, and bitter wisdom to thy young
men of war;</p>

<p>19. Who boundeth pain by peace, and setteth a term unto love;</p>

<p>20. Who hath no truce with the day, and slayeth the dark with the
sword of mighty mornings;</p>

<p>21. Who buildeth the house of life with colored beams, and the
house of death without a door;</p>

<p>22. Who hath set harps in hell, and given pure gold for the winding
sheet of kings;</p>

<p>23. By Whose breath are the Signs shaken; as a swarm of gnats are
they troubled by the wind of His passing;</p>

<p>24. Who yoketh stars to His harrow, and the whirlwind to drag his
plough on great waters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_138" id="page_138">{138}</a></span></p>

<p>25. Take counsel of Me; behold what shapes I have set as My
servants.</p>

<p>26. The sun is a coal of My hearth, the moon an ember that I have
quenched;</p>

<p>27. Shall not I make her a desolation, and a rock where devils
worship?</p>

<p>28. Shall not My gulfs conceive, and Mine angels whet their scythes
against the day of My reaping?</p>

<p>29. Be thou abased, for they are yet unborn that shall lay thee
out; the worm is unhatched that shall consume thee.</p>

<p>30. Wilt thou hold forth to Me thy heart in thy hand; or turn for
Me its leaves that thou hast writ?</p>

<p>31. Thy wisdom profiteth thee nothing, neither the guards within
thy citadels.</p>

<p>32. Shall I consider for long the mighty, or the habitations of the
strong?<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_139" id="page_139">{139}</a></span></p>

<p>33. Behold! blood shall be in their courts for wine, and the
moaning of their concubines for the voice of the viol.</p>

<p>34. I shall break their temples as a shard; their high pillars
shall be snapt as a bow-string.</p>

<p>35. My tempests shall neigh in the walled cities; My grass shall
lift up her sword against them;</p>

<p>36. The toad shall be judge there; the jackal shall collect the
tax;</p>

<p>37. The owl shall feed her young on their altars; the dung of lions
shall be thereon for a testimony.</p>

<p>38. Wert thou upon the flint when I confirmed it, or upon the
granite when I laid its sheets?</p>

<p>39. The thunder, was it thou that didst call? Was the rain the
tears of thy bringing-forth?</p>

<p>40. Be thou bowed down, nor question the pains that I have set over
thee: for each thing have I ordained its shadow.</p>

<p>41. My thoughts are from eternity; I change not<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_140" id="page_140">{140}</a></span> by reason of thy
dismay. Thou shalt know Me for the Lord.</p>

<p>42. Who setteth Capella and Achernar to be gods for a term, and a
guide upon the deep to strange peoples;</p>

<p>43. Who maketh Altair and Rigel the captains of His host; Who
leaneth His spear upon Sirius ere the trumpets call;</p>

<p>44. Who holdeth Vega His armor-bearer, and hangeth his buckler upon
Aldebaran;</p>

<p>45. Who hath convoked their chariots against the lamps of Evil, and
their swords against the abyss.</p>

<p>46. Who healeth the day with night, and thy heart’s wound with the
hands of little children;</p>

<p>47. Even they that seek the breast in darkness, hushing the voices
that were aforetime.</p>

<p>48. The wind cometh, the dust is troubled for a season, but hath
rest when the wind departeth. </p></div>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
